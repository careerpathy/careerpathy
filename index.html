            <img src="./public/portrait.jpeg">
            <p>I'm Chislaine Cruz, founder of Careerpathy. As a former bootcamp student and teaching fellow, I am incredibly passionate about teaching others how to code and helping them achieve a fulfilling and rewarding career in the tech industry.</p>
            <p>
              Since 2021, I have been working as a Fullstack Software Engineer, starting my journey as an apprentice and gradually transitioning into a full-time engineering role. Throughout my career, I have gained invaluable experiences and insights that have shaped my understanding of the industry. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Driven by the desire to share my knowledge and experiences, I wrote a couple of articles detailing my personal journey as a bootcamp graduate transitioning into my first full-time job. These resonated with many aspiring software engineers who reached out to me seeking guidance and support.
            </p>
