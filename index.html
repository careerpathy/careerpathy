            <p>
              Hi there, I'm Chislaine Cruz, founder of Careerpathy. My journey to start this company stemmed from a desire to share my personal experiences with aspiring software engineers.

              I wrote a couple of articles detailing my path as a bootcamp grad landing my first full-time engineering role. To my surprise, these pieces deeply resonated with people new to tech who reached out to me for guidance. I realized the value I could provide those embarking on an engineering career. And so, Careerpathy was born! 
            </p>
            <p>
              As a Latina who changed careers in my late 20s, I chose to attend a coding bootcamp in 2020 to learn web development. In 2021, I landed my first job as a Fullstack Apprentice Engineer. With time and effort, I progressed to a full-time engineering position. 

              Beyond my own career transition, I've gained valuable experience mentoring aspiring engineers. I served as a mentor for the Fullstack Academy bootcamp students during their studies. Currently, I mentor engineers at Formation across all levels of experience - from entry level developers to seasoned professionals. Working with this diverse group has allowed me to provide tailored guidance empowering engineers at any stage of their careers. </p>
              <p>
              These mentoring opportunities have allowed me to guide many through the challenges I once faced. I've cultivated the knowledge and empathy required to help individuals achieve their career goals in tech. My mission is empowering newcomers to enhance their skills and realize their potential.
